# Problem 1

Starting out with loading library and data

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)

data("early_january_weather")
```


describing the data with a summary, the number of rows, the number of columns, and the mean of the variable "temp"

```{r descriptive}
summary(early_january_weather)

nrow(early_january_weather)

ncol(early_january_weather)

mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

Scatterplot for time_hour and temp, color by variable humid 

```{r scatterplot}

P1_scatter<-ggplot(data = early_january_weather,
                   aes(x=time_hour, y=temp, color=humid))+
  geom_point()

print(P1_scatter)

```




There seems to be an overall positive relationship between temp and time_hour.
